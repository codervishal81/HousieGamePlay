# Housie Game Play
This is learning project for learning Python.

It simulates the game of Housie. Tickets are created for players and numbers are drawn one by one. Game ends when we get at least one ticket with full house.

To run, execute main.py

This is learning project so code is not written in best possible way.
Test cases are missing.
Game state reversal is not possible, like if we want to see the state of game by undoing last n drawn numbers.
Number of rows and columns in ticket are hard coded so can not increase/decrease the rows, columns and numbers on the ticket.
